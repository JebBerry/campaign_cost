# campaign_cost

This is my solution to the coding assignment Campaign Cost

This program is coded in Java and I developed it using the Eclipse IDE
This program will take in two command line arguments (size and channels) to calculate the cost based on provided paramenters.

To run this program check out the code to your desiered IDE in order to see my code.
Alter the command line arguements to be as follows:
"-size <WHOLE_NUMBER> -channel EM|SMS|DM"

Then run the program and the console will display the total cost.
